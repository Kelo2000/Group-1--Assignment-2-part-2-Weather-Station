# Indoor and Personal Weather station.

Group 1 - Assignment 2 Part 2 -  

# Objective : 
 The Weather station is the devide that shows relevant information about the temperature and relative humidity on both the M5 Screen as well as a webpage hosted on the device. This device program will creates a WiFi Access point and also controls the screen of M5 atom using the webserver. .
 
 This weather station will be mounted onto a specific item in a room as well as be attached to a person or an object that is carried to make it portable.
